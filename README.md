# Crypto Tracker

Crypto Tracker is a website that is powered by the CoinGecko API. It also implements a number of Angular Material modules in 
order to generate the frontend of the application. The backend (middleware) part of the website is run on NodeJS and the code for it can be
found on my github page (https://github.com/DzoniTheNick/crypto-tracker-backend).
